# TDS [new name to be determined]

The premium edition of standard TDS Enduro Algarve Day tour for riders who want more, a multi-day all-enclusive enduro experience with the best accomodation (sea front) bikes, gear, top local prtuguese cuisine and more.

## Introduction

TDS Enduo Tours Algarve started as a small business in algarve founded by Francisco Dos Santos in 2020, a hard enduro enthusiast who has ridden enduro for over 10 years and participated in some of the hardest enduro races in the world such as The Roof of Africa (3 times), Extreme XL Lagares, Madron, Monsaraz and more. 

Originally from South Africa, Francisco went to Portugal on holiday wanting to ride enduro but did'nt have any options where he could just hop on a bike and let out the enduro itch we enduro riders get often.
So two years later when he moved to Portugal he decided to start his own enduro tour business allowing visitors from other countries in the same situation as himself the oppurtinity to ride enduro whether they are beginners, pros, big groups or solo.

## Reason for rebranding

Till now TDS has been doing well locally and in some parts of UK and Europe online, however all the clients have been visitors trabelling from all over the globe just to ride enduro in Algarve as it is an enduro haven (which there are few of now due to increasing restrictions and laws against riding enduro in many coutnries especially in europe and the uk bringing a lot of them to algarve). 

Thus I want to rebrand TDS to create new pacakages under "Ultimate Edition" that including multiple day tours with included accomodation and everything else you could possible need (see offers section for info).

## Keeping the family busy while you ride

Algarve is a happening place full of acitivites for your family or friends who don;t ride to keep themselves busy so you get time for yourself

- Shopping center (Mar Shopping) (make an articel aboue why you should leave your wife at the shopping center while you ride a motorbike on your holiday)
- Beach (best beaches in europe, Falesia in vilamoura voted best in europe 2024)
- Dog volunteering (many women enjoy going to the rescue shelter to look after and play dogs)
